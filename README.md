Docker Maven Plugin
===

This project aims to make it it easy to build an app on a container, test it and push it to a Docker repository, even if it relies on other containers (e.g. a database). 
We tend to talk "Maven" rather than "Docker" (E.g. "package" rather than "build"). And we like to keep it simple.

* Do you want to know how to [get started](USAGE.md)?
* [Having problems](DEBUG.md)?
* What to get [involved or add features](CONTRIB.md)? 
* What to know what's [changed recently](CHANGELOG.md)?

Using another tool? I have an [Ant version](https://github.com/alexec/docker-ant-tasks), and a [Gradle version](https://github.com/alexec/docker-gradle-plugin) (SBT coming soon...).

There are [4 popular plugins](COMPETITORS.md) you might wish to look at.
